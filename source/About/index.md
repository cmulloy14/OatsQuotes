## The Site for Everything Oat

My name is Pat Mulloy, but ever since a trophy engraver's mis-graving of an O instead of a P on my soccer team participation trophy, circa 2002, the nickname of "Oat" has been etched in to my persona as deeply as that O was etched in to the plaque on that cheap trophy.


These days I spend considerably less time participating in U-9 soccer leagues, and more time exploring the space of iOS development other things I find interesting. 


This site is a sort of homebase for me. You'll find posts that detail personal project's I'm working on, as well as posts that are simply whatever I feel like posting.
